We have used the balancing technique in SPSS and R to balance the data and used the oversampling method where we increased the minority class.
In this coursework, we tried the different balancing ratios to have an efficient data model: 70-30, 60-40, 50-50

Algorithm Used
Since we are predicting categorical variables, we have used the following data mining models,
Random Tree (SPSS)
CHAID (SPSS)
C5 (R)
Logistic Regression (R)

Benefits of these models are,
Easy to interpret and analyze.
Able to process large datasets.
